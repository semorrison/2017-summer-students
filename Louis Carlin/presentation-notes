Quick explanation of lean
- type theory (very basic)
- proofs as types
- tactics mode (context and goals)


What I did
euclidean domains 

Explanation of pre-existing structures
- wiki hierarchy: commutative rings > integral domains euclidean domains
- lean hierarchy :

integral domain with:
- remainder : \a \to \a \to \a
- mod : \a \to \a \to \a
- witness a = (a/b)*b + (a%b)
- valuation (where do I start?)

euclidean algorithm
- explain how it works on the board
- initial implementation 
    - takes proof as input and gives proofs as output
- second implementation
    - no proofs as input or output
    - induction principle (explain well founded induction here)

well-founded induction (do some on board?)
- more general form of induction
- explain what well founded means
    - all elements are accessible in the relation (an element is accessible if all the elements less that it are accessible)
- requires
