trouble with sets (undecidable)

Playing around with bijections (wanted to do combinatorics stuff)
trouble trying to define abs and with coercion
how to define bijection (my initial attempt vs scott's) 
Typeclasses and inference
Naive bijection nat int is tedious, Scott suggests composition
How to show composition of bijections is bijection (notation is annoying)

A good strategy is to look in the proof of integer lemmas because they are often based off nat lemmas
had trouble pattern matching ( can't simply list all members of fin n?)
stuck pattern matching inside proof (want to pattern match on nat \times fin 2)
