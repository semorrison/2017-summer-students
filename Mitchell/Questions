As I understand it, the notation [group A] is meant to look for an instance of a proof that A is a group.
But I don't get any errors when I write [group nat]

When to use structure vs class?

instance fun_to_hom {G : group α} {H : group β} : has_coe_to_fun (hom G H) :=
{ F   := λ f, α → β,
coe := hom.map }

Could we overload construction so that it can be used in either a bundled or non-bundled form?
