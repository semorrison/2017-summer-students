As I understand it, the notation [group A] is meant to look for an instance of a proof that A is a group.
But I don't get any errors when I write [group nat]

When to use structure vs class?

Can I use an instance as a theorem? I've created preimage as an instance of a subgroup.
I now want to use the fact that preimages are subgroups, but can't figure out how.
